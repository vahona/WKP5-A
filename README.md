### What I succed to code in this?

   - I created HTML and insert the value of each element from the recipes array to show the tips of dish in javascript and also clicl button event listener which show the the structure of tip dish.
   - After, I created modal, The modal container I put it in the html but the containt I created it in javascript. 
   - I try to put event listener in the modal, 

### Does my project meet the requirement?

   - It does not meet the requirement because when I click the button, no matter which button in the more information button, It always show the last array of the recipe, to be specific, the containt of the last array in the recepies which I think really bad.
   - I could not get data set to work in my project. 


### If I had more time

   - If I had more time, first I would give a better style for my code, I mean updating css to make it better.
   - Then I would try to find out to finish my project, data which I really don't know. I would look for document which can guide me in that.
   - Also I would Indent my code proply so that it will looks good and apropriate.

### Causes the error

   - I have an error in my code because I try to set the data set but it does not work. Also I don't really understant data yet but I just try.
